            <p>Pizza is the greatest cuisine in the world and my favorite food. We’like to believe a majority of
                the world has had a pizza in some way or form. First, let’s focus on the taste.</p>

                <h3>About Pizza KingDom</h3>
                <p>
                    The year was 2001. The place, Lalbug, Dhaka. Our founder, Unus Masum, realized that his community
                    was
                    hungry for irresistible pizzas, served up with authentic Dhaka City hospitality. The answer was
                    Pizza
                    KingDom— a cozy, neighborhood hangout with a welcoming atmosphere and some of the best, most
                    original
                    tastes in town. It quickly became the place where family and friends came to enjoy great meals and
                    memories, time and again. Over 20 years later, Pizza KingDom has been one of the oldest and
                    longest-held, single-family businesses in Dhaka City. Stop by one of our many Dhaka City-area
                    locations
                    today and discover why Pizza KingDom is Dhaka City’s ORIGINAL Neighborhood Pizza Place!

                <img src="photos/Greek_Pizza.png" alt="" srcset="">
                <h3>Greek Pizza</h3>
                <p>Greek pizza is usually heavier on the sauce than the cheese. The sauce typically has a tangy tomato
                    paste with a strong oregano flavor. It is often only topped with cheese, which is usually a mix of
                    mozzarella and cheddar or provolone. It may feature a variety of non-Greek or Greek toppings, such
                    as feta cheese, black olives, and red onion.</p>

            <div id="silian" class="item-name">
                <img src="photos/Sicilian_Pizza.png" alt="" srcset="">
                <h3>Sicilian Pizza</h3>
                <p>To bring out the flavor of your Sicilian pizza dough, try lining your pan with an olive oil blend.
                    The temperature of your oven will determine how long you should bake your pie. For example, if your
                    oven is heated to 425 degrees Fahrenheit, it should take about 15 - 20 minutes to bake your Sicilian
                    pizza.
                </p>

                <img src="photos/Neapolitan_Pizza.png" alt="" srcset="">
                <h3>Neapolitan Pizza</h3>
                <p>The typical Neapolitan pizza toppings are fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil leaves, oregano, and
                    olive oil. Since Neapolitan pizza is thin, it isn't designed to handle the weight of too many
                    toppings. In fact, Neapolitan pizza is so thin that it's typically eaten with a fork and knife.
